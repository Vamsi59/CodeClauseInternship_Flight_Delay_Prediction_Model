# CodeClauseInternship_Flight_Delay_Prediction_Model

The objective of the project is to perform analysis of the historic flight data to gain valuable insights and build a predictive model to predict whether a flight will be delayed or not given a set of flight characteristics.

The objective of the predictive model is to build a model to predict whether a flight will be delayed or not based on certain characteristics of the flight. Such a model may help both passengers as well as airline companies to predict future delays and minimize them.

**The output whether the flight is delayed or not depends on the time; if the flight is late by 15 minutes or more then it is declared as delayed.**

**Technologies Used:**
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn
5. Sklearn
6. Random Forest Regressor from Sklearn
7. Gradient Boosting Regressor from Sklearn
8. SVR from sklearn
